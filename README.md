# SEBasicsWorkshop
Hello GitHub!
Stand Up Notes with (anuragk@vt.edu)(Anurag Kulkarni): 
1)I created a git hub repository with files. We also created a project board in this workshop
2)I need to get a better understanding of software development through the assingments
3)What is blocking me is my time as I need to organize it better to take care of the assignments
